Main.java
	main()
		Input:
			Create a scanner to get input
			Prompt user for driver data file name
			Read input line
			Prompt user for command file name
			Read input line
			Close the input scanner
		Output/Processing:
			Create linked list using driver data from specified file
			Ensure that we were able to successfully do this and that we actually generated a linked list
			Read in the commands from the command file specified and print needed data
	Functions needed in Main:
		helper function to ensure a number is a double
		function to process the driver data and return a linked list with that data in it
			a helper function to generate driver object from a line in the data file
			another helper function to calculate the area from the points
		function to process the command data and output to console any command output
			helper function for the sort command
			helper command for the filter command
				helper for sorting by name
				helper for sorting by area
		helper function to check if a driver name is valid
	
LinkedList.java
	Sort function:
		Uses bubble sort to sort function
		compareTo is modified to change how it sorts (determines sort type and sort direction)
		Algorithm/Logic:
			loop until sorted
				loop thru each node
					determine if node to right of current is smaller. if so, swap
				determine if we made any swaps in above loop. if not, its already sorted, if so, continue to sort 
				  (it is guarenteed to be sorted after n loops with n = size of linked list)
		function to swap a node at given index with node to its right (next node)
