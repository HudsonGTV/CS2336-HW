Grades Received for the Projects:
Project 1: 80% (i think i messed up the max size of coords, as I did not create enough test cases with max possible coords)
Project 2: 89% (not sure what i did wrong, maybe i forgot to check for specific invalid input?)
Project 3: 100%

Note that we were not given test data and had to create our own. I have learned from these projects to create more extensive test data to ensure that I cover every edge case (as can be seen from grades going up after each project).
